SETTING UP THE DATA
Upon download of the Eskwelabs - DS Cohort 10 Sprint 1 Materials folder in your local machine, please do the following:
1. Go to Eskwelabs - DS Cohort 10 Sprint 1 Materials > data.
2. Copy world_data.csv.
3. Paste the data to each folder (Day 1, 2, 3 and so on).
4. Now, you may proceed to setting up your environment.

SETTING UP YOUR ENVIRONMENT
1. Make sure Python is installed (3.9).
2. Install virtualenv by running "pip install virtualenv" in your terminal.
2. Using the terminal, navigate to the folder containing the Eskwelabs - DS Cohort 10 Sprint 1 Materials. Assuming you decided to put Eskwelabs - DS Cohort 10 Sprint 1 in your Documents/Eskwelabs folder then we are pertaining to the Eskwelabs folder. 
3. Create a virtual environment by running "virtualenv <name of your env>". Usually, we use venv as name of our virtual environment. Go back to the file directory in step 2. If creation of virtual environment is successful, you should see a folder with the name of your env. 
4. In the terminal, activate the virtual environment by running "source <name of your env>/bin/activate". The command might vary depending on your OS (Mac, Windows, Linux). Note that you should run this in the same folder containing your env folder.
5. You should now see a (venv) on the left side of your terminal. This implies that your virtual environment is activated.
6. Now, go to Eskwelabs - DS Cohort 10 Sprint 1 Materials folder. You should be done setting up the data (as discussed above) before you proceed. 
7. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt". Pip will install all packages we need for this sprint. Wait for a moment as pip install the packages in your local machine.
8. Run "jupyter" and you should be able to run your Jupyter notebooks by now. 
9. When you are done coding, exit Jupyter and type "deactivate" in your terminal. 
10. Repeat step 4 onwards when you will start coding again.

In case of questions, ask your mentor/instructor. Happy coding!
